an newly created board should have 0 items
an newly created board should have area used of 0

adding a square with a side of length 2 to an empty board,
  the area used on the board is 4
adding two squares with sides of length 2 to an empty board,
  the area used on the board is 8
adding a circle with a radius of length 3 to an empty board,
  then the area used on the board is 28.27
adding a circle with a radius of length 4 is added to an empty and
   then adding a square with a side of length 5,
   then the area used on the board is 75.27

given a board with a circle with radius 100
  and two squares of length 10 and 5,
  when the circle is removed,
  the area used should be 125 and the number of items should be 2

given a board of size 100
  adding a square of size with sides of length 12
  should result in a "shape too large" error
